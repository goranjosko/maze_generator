# Backtracking maze generation algorithm

Simple backtracking maze generation algorithm done in pygame. 
Random function weights can be adjusted so that the maze prefers straight lines or a meandering path (maze_settings.py) 
The labyrinth, maze, is saved in png format for possible printing.
The code is object-oriented, so it's easier for me to add new features in the future

maze_sinBias.py version uses the sine function to determine the weights, so the maze goes from a version that prefers straight lines to a version that prefers meandering.
