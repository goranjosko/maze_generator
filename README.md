# Backtracking maze generation algorithm

Simple backtracking maze generation algorithm done in pygame. 
Random function weights can be adjusted so that the maze prefers straight lines or a meandering path. 
The labyrinth, maze, is saved in png format for possible printing.
The code is object-oriented, so it's easier for me to add new features in the future
